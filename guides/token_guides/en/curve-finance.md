# Curve in Simple Terms

[Curve Finance](https://curve.fi) is a decentralized, Uniswap-like exchange but built specifically for [stablecoins](../../defi/en/5-stablecoins.md).

With DeFi growing in popularity there is a bigger demand now for trading between pairs of stablecoins, and thatâ€™s where Curve comes into play. Stablecoins are typically in high demand in DeFi ecosystem. 

Curve has a large turnover volume, frequently exceeding over [50 million USD](https://www.curve.fi/dailystats). 

## Curve Token

Curve plans to become a DAO and has a governance token CRV which provides [additional perks](https://guides.curve.fi/crv-launches-curve-dao-and-crv/) when interacting with Curve services including voting capabilities on important decisions.

Total supply: about 3 billion

- 61% to liquidity providers
- 31% to shareholders
- 5% to burnable reserves
- 3% to employees

## Trading on Curve

- Curve's uniques selling point comes from its trading algorithm which provides better prices when buying or selling large amount of cryptocurrency stablecoins.

- In comparison to [Uniswap](../../token_guides/en/uniswap.md), Curve has a slightly higher fee for each trade measured at 0.04% of the trading amount.

## Liquidity Providers

Liquidity pools on Curve are generally more profitable than pools on uniswap. 

Apart from collecting trading fees, Curve's liquidity pools lend spare funds to external [DeFi lending](../../defi/en/4-lending-protocols.md) services and earn liquidity providers even more income. 

- At present, 4 out of 7 liquidity pools on Curve earn liquidity providers not only from trading fees but from lending liquidity to [Compound](../../token_guides/en/compound.md) lending pool as well.

- Curve's liquidity pools do not require liquidity provider to deposit all tokens involved in the pool. The provider can just deposit one stablecoin.

- Liquidity providers may deposit a single asset and use it to provide liquidity to multiple Curve pools.

- Some Curve pools offer additional bonuses aimed at keeping pools balanced. When user deposits token that has a low share of the pool, s/he earns a deposit bonus. 

- Conversely, there are also bonuses for withdrawing a stablecoin that's predominant in the given pool.

## Pool Profitability
 
- When depositing funds to a liquidity pool, regardless of whether you are depositing multiple tokens or just one, your deposits will be auto-split into multiple tokens based on token distribution in the pool.

- If you decide to deposit 4 DAI tokens to the pool that has 200 DAI (50%), 100 USDT (25%) and 100 USDC(25%) tokens, then your deposit will be split in 2 DAI, 1 USDT and 1 USDC.

- When withdrawing from a pool you will be typically withdrawing in all pool tokens, regardless of which token you deposit.

- Due to versatile pool deposit mechanisms, adding funds to liquidity pools can be quite expensive when Ethereum network is busy.

## Risks

Curve Finance significantly more complex than Uniswap and integrates some third party DeFi services into its products. 

So, from security point of view there is a higher chance of potential undiscovered issues in a smart contract.
