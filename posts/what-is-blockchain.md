# What Is Blockchain? A Simple Explanation

![](images/blockchain.png)

Blockchains underpin Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies. But they also have lots of uses outside of payment services.

So, what is a blockchain? How do they work? And what can you use a blockchain for? Keep reading to find out.

## What Is a Blockchain?

Blockchains are “distributed ledgers” that store digital data. Each participant gets a copy of the existing data and the opportunity to confirm new data.

Let’s illustrate by contrasting a blockchain with a bank.

Your bank maintains a central database (a “ledger”) of all their customer details. This may store account numbers, balances, transactions, and more. Whenever you interact with your account (such as by withdrawing money or making a transfer), your bank updates its records.

Only the bank has access to the ledger, so if they decide to make a change (even one that’s wrong), there’s not much you can do to change it, short of making a complaint.
